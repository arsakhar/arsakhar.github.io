Identifying new ways to maintain cognitive and brain health throughout the lifespan is of utmost importance. Simultaneous exercise and cognitive engagement has been shown to enhance brain function in animal and human studies. Virtual reality (VR) may be a promising approach for conducting simultaneous exercise and cognitive studies. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of cycling in a cognitively enriched and immersive spatial navigation VR environment in younger and older adults.","tags":["Virtual Reality"],"title":"Cycling and spatial navigation in an enriched, immersive 3D virtual park environment: A feasibility study in younger and older adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashwin R Sakhare","Giuseppe Barisano","Judy Pa"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1557550742,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590296342,"objectID":"2105ade69e7195bdf97287ac9e04882b","permalink":"https://arsakhar.github.io/publication/magneticresonancemedicine/","publishdate":"2019-05-10T21:59:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magneticresonancemedicine/","section":"publication","summary":"Pathological states occur when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) dynamics become dysregulated in the brain. Phase‐contrast MRI (PC‐MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that enables quantitative measurements of CSF and CBF flow. While studies have validated PC‐MRI as an imaging technique for flow, few studies have evaluated its reliability for CSF and CBF flow parameters commonly associated with neurological disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate test–retest reliability at the cerebral aqueduct (CA) and C2‐C3 area using PC‐MRI to assess the feasibility of investigating CSF and CBF flow dynamics.","tags":["Brain Imaging"],"title":"Assessing test–retest reliability of phase contrast MRI for measuring cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral blood flow dynamics","type":"publication"}]
