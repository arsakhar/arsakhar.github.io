      <title>Ranking College Football Coaches</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m an avid college football fan with a keen interest in data science. For my first dive into data science, I will use some basic statistics and data manipulation to evaluate coaching in college football.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Defining the Problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Football is the crown jewel and breadwinner in any collegiate athletic department. A successful football program is not only a source of revenue for the university, it is also a powerful marketing tool, as studies have shown winning to be associated with increased donations, academic reputation, and lower acceptance rates. Therefore, it’s no surprise that coaches wield significant power and lofty salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coaches also carry the burden of high expectations, poor job security, and an average tenure of only 3.8 years. While the decision to hire or fire a coach is a multi-factorial process, it is primarily driven by their record. Consequently, a coach’s value, particularly with donors and fans, is inextricably tied to their performance on the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, wins and losses are driven by several factors, many of which are outside a coach’s control, including conference affiliation, prestige, location, historical success, and financial investment from the university. As such, a coach’s record is not the most objective way to assess their value. In this project we will set out to define an approach for evaluating coaches while minimizing the impact of these confounding factors. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sal&#39;s Sanctuary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Overview &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first in a trilogy of virtual reality exergames designed to enhance brain health. Your adventure begins as a rookie ranger at Sal&amp;rsquo;s Sanctuary, a nature reserve for animals set in an urban environment. The animal&amp;rsquo;s have escaped the sanctuary and you are tasked with locating and returning them safely. Your selective attention and spatial navigation abilities will be tested each time you conduct a rescue mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are assigned to one route each day and will be required to make at least 4 search and rescue trips along this route. Once an animal is located, you will pick it up and bring it back to the gates of the sanctuary before starting your next search and rescue. You are also required to pick up any food along the route that is associated with the diet of the animal you have rescued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first two rescue missions, we will provide visual guidance to help you learn the route. After 2 rescue missions, you are required to remember the route using only the landmarks and environment as your guidance. At the beginning of each new day, prior to starting your 4 rescue missions, you will be required to remember and navigate the route from the previous day. The difficulty of your routes will increase and the routes will get longer as you start rescuing animals located farther away from the sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wildlife Enclosure</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second in our trilogy of virtual reality exergames. You start the game as the chief ranger at Sal&amp;rsquo;s Wildlife Enclosure, a nature reserve for animals set in a savannah, jungle, safari, and aviary. You are tasked with taking care of all the animal&amp;rsquo;s in the wildlife enclosure. Your missions consist of feeding animals, treating injured animals at the vet clinic, putting out fires, and repairing broken equipment. There are two primary cognitive skills assessed each day you bike around the enclosure to complete your missions: selective attention and spatial navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the selective attention task, you are required to pick up objects associated with your mission. For example, if you are putting out a fire, you will be required to pickup axes and fire extinguishers on the way. For spatial navigation, you are assigned to one route each day. You will complete 4 missions, each time biking along the same route. For the first two missions, we will provide arrows to help you learn the route. After 2 missions, you are required to remember the route using only the landmarks and environment as cues. At the beginning of each day, prior to starting your 4 missions, you will be required to remember and navigate the route from the previous day. The difficulty of your routes will increase and the routes will get longer as you start moving towards the perimeter of the wildlife enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
